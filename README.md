Sorry about that. Hi, I'm Harry 👋

👀 I love all things relating to: eCommerce, SEO, and whimsical Web Development 😎
My main line of work is utilising .NET but I'm picking up more and more modern JS projects.
🌱 I’m currently learning Vue/Nuxt.js as well as working on my UI skills in my spare time. I'm also working on my understanding of cloud-based services like AWS.
